<h1><b>iphone </b></h1>

<p> There is less and less time left before the release of iPhone 12 smartphones, and more and more details about them appear online. For example, a source published a table with the full dimensions of all iPhone smartphones. As you can see, the future iPhone 12 Pro Max has become the largest Apple smartphone in the history of their existence.
The iPhone 12 Pro Max isn’t really much bigger than the iPhone 11 Pro Max, although the screen diagonal has grown by 0.2 inches. And the thickness is even less – 7.4 mm instead of 8.1 mm in the current flagship. So the idea that the iPhone 12 Pro Max is very inconvenient to use due to its large size, should be considered only the personal opinions of reviewers. In fact, those who opted for the iPhone 11 Pro Max will not consider the iPhone 12 Pro Max inconvenient to use a smartphone. Although the status of the largest iPhone in history does not cancel it.

 <h2><b> Nokia</b></h2>
 
<p>Nokia’s transition to a primary focus on telecommunications began in the 1990s. The first GSM call was made in 1991 using Nokia equipment. Rapid success in the mobile phone sector allowed Nokia to become by 1998, the best-selling mobile phone brand in the world. In 2003 Nokia introduced the first camera phone. In 2011, to address increasing competition from iOS and Android operating systems, Nokia entered into a strategic partnership with Microsoft. In 2014 Nokia sold its mobile and devices division to Microsoft.
The creation of Nokia Networks, following the buy-out of joint-venture partner Siemens in 2013, laid the foundation for Nokia’s transformation into primarily a network hardware and software provider.
